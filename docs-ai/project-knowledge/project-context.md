# Project Context

## Overview

## Goals

## Essential Information

- Human docs live in `docs/`; the primary guide is `docs/application-development-guide.md`.
- Agent knowledge/prompts/artifacts live in `docs-ai/` (routed via `KB_ROOTS`).
- Service boundaries are represented by top-level runtime folders (`frontend/`, `ai/`, `supabase/`, `infra/`) per `KB_REPOSITORY_RULES`.
- Protected contracts (must-not-break defaults) live in `DOC_PROJECT_PROTECTED_CONTRACTS`.

## Project tech stack

Current project stack: not set yet. Until defined, use the baseline in `KB_TECH_STACK`.

If the project stack changes, update this section and get user approval. If the baseline changes, update `KB_TECH_STACK` as well (also requires user approval).
